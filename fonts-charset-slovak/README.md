# List of fonts supporting Slovak character set

**A reference of popular web font sources supporting all Slovak character set.** (Also, when tested with Czech character set, the results are recorded as well.)


## Font sources

Feel free to browse the supported fonts organized by sources:

- [Adobe Typekit](/fonts-charset-slovak/google-fonts/)
- [Google Fonts](/fonts-charset-slovak/typekit-fonts/)


## Tests

All of the fonts in this reference were tested for correct displaying of [all Slovak (and Czech) alphabet special characters](/fonts-charset-slovak/TESTS.md).


## Purpose

There are multiple sources from where you can use a stylish (free) web fonts for your website and projects. However, even though a certain font claims support for `latin-extended` character set, in many cases the support is partial only, failing to display all Slovak alphabet special characters.

This project was created to provide an easy reference of tested **fonts with 100% compatibility for Slovak alphabet** (and possibly Czech too).
